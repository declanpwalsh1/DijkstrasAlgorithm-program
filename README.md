# DijkstrasAlgorithm-program
This program uses Dijkstras algorithm to find this shortest path and works its way across several given files in the project to determine shortest paths


This program uses the built-in C++ list function as it's linked list and applies Dijkstra's algorithm to it.

Still has some bugs CAVEAT EMPTOR
